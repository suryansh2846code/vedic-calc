"""Sade Sati and related Saturn transit afflictions calculator.

Covers three types of Saturn-over-Moon transits:
  1. **Sade Sati** (7.5-year cycle): Saturn in 12th, 1st (same), or 2nd sign from Moon.
     - Rising phase: Saturn in the sign before Moon's sign (12th from Moon)
     - Peak phase: Saturn in the same sign as Moon
     - Setting phase: Saturn in the sign after Moon's sign (2nd from Moon)
  2. **Small Panoti** (Kantaka Shani): Saturn in the 4th sign from Moon.
  3. **Ashtama Shani**: Saturn in the 8th sign from Moon.

All three are sign-based (whole-sign transits), not degree-based.

Some traditional sources (and Prokerala) group all three under a single
"Sade Sati" umbrella. ``SadeSatiResult.is_active`` preserves that umbrella
reading, but the three are *also* reported as separate flags —
``is_sade_sati``, ``is_small_panoti``, ``is_ashtama_shani`` — because they are
distinct afflictions of different lengths, and because most other software
reports them separately. Calling Small Panoti "Sade Sati" to a user puts us in
direct contradiction with every other app they check.

Prefer the specific flags when presenting a result. See
``docs/accuracy.md``.
