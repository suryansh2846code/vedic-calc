"""
Pydantic models for all Vedic astrology data structures.

These are the primary data types returned by vedic-calc functions.
All models are frozen (immutable) and JSON-serializable.

WHY FROZEN (IMMUTABLE)?
    A birth chart, once calculated, should never change. Making models
    frozen (via `frozen=True`) enforces this at runtime — any attempt to
    modify a field after creation raises an error. This prevents subtle
    bugs where chart data is accidentally mutated.

WHY PYDANTIC?
    Pydantic gives us automatic validation (e.g., longitude must be 0-360),
    JSON serialization (for APIs), and clean type hints — all for free.
    These models are the "contract" between the calculation engine and
    any consuming application (API, CLI, agent, etc.).

GLOSSARY FOR NEWCOMERS:
    - Kundli / Janma Patri = birth chart
    - Graha = planet (9 in Vedic astrology, including Rahu/Ketu)
    - Rashi = zodiac sign (12 signs, each 30°)
    - Nakshatra = lunar mansion (27 divisions, each 13°20')
    - Pada = quarter of a nakshatra (each 3°20', 108 total)
    - Bhava = house (12 houses in a chart)
    - Lagna = ascendant (the rising sign at birth)
    - Dasha = planetary period (time periods ruled by planets)
    - Panchanga = five-limbed daily calendar (tithi, nakshatra, yoga, karana, vara)

    """Information about a nakshatra (lunar mansion) position.

    WHAT IS A NAKSHATRA?
        The zodiac is divided into 27 nakshatras (lunar mansions), each
        spanning 13°20' (13.333°). These are the oldest layer of Vedic
        astrology, predating the 12-sign zodiac. The Moon moves through
        roughly one nakshatra per day (~13.3° daily motion).

        Each nakshatra has:
        - A ruling planet (lord) — cycles through Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon,
          Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury (repeating 3x for 27)
        - 4 padas (quarters) of 3°20' (3.333°) each — used for finer
          predictions and for determining the first syllable of a person's
          name in Indian tradition

    WHY IT MATTERS:
        The Moon's birth nakshatra (Janma Nakshatra) determines which
        planetary period (dasha) you're born into. It's also used for
        compatibility matching (Ashtakoot) in marriages.

    Attributes:
        nakshatra: The nakshatra (1-27). See constants.py for all 27.
        pada: The pada/quarter within the nakshatra (1-4).

class DashaPeriod(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    """A single dasha (planetary period) with start and end dates.

    WHAT IS THE DASHA SYSTEM?
        Vedic astrology divides a person's life into periods ruled by
        different planets. The Vimsottari dasha system (the most widely
        used) divides 120 years into 9 major periods (mahadashas):

        Ketu=7, Venus=20, Sun=6, Moon=10, Mars=7, Rahu=18,
        Jupiter=16, Saturn=19, Mercury=17 (total = 120 years)

        Each mahadasha is subdivided into sub-periods (antardashas),
        which are further divided into sub-sub-periods (pratyantardashas).
        The subdivision uses the same proportional ratios.

    HOW IS YOUR STARTING DASHA DETERMINED?
        The Moon's nakshatra at birth determines which planet's dasha
        you're born into, and how much of it remains. For example, if
        the Moon is in Rohini (ruled by Moon), you start in Moon dasha.
        How far the Moon has traversed through Rohini determines how
        much of the 10-year Moon dasha has already elapsed at birth.

    """Daily Panchanga — the five elements of a Vedic day.

    WHAT IS PANCHANGA?
        "Pancha" = five, "Anga" = limb. The Panchanga is a daily Vedic
        calendar that tracks five astronomical elements:

        1. TITHI (Lunar Day) — 30 per month
           Based on the angular distance between Moon and Sun.
           Each tithi = 12° of Moon-Sun separation.
           Tithis 1-15 = Shukla Paksha (waxing, bright half)
           Tithis 16-30 = Krishna Paksha (waning, dark half)
           Formula: tithi = floor((moon_lon - sun_lon) / 12) + 1

        2. NAKSHATRA (Moon's Lunar Mansion) — 27 total
           Which of the 27 nakshatras the Moon is transiting today.
           The Moon spends roughly one day in each nakshatra.

        3. YOGA (Luni-Solar Combination) — 27 total
           Based on the SUM of Moon and Sun longitudes.
           Each yoga = 13°20' of (moon_lon + sun_lon).
           Formula: yoga = floor((moon_lon + sun_lon) / 13.333) + 1
           Despite the similar span, yogas are unrelated to nakshatras.

        4. KARANA (Half-Tithi) — 60 per month
           Each tithi has 2 karanas. There are 11 types:
           4 fixed karanas (appear once each per month) +
           7 repeating karanas (cycle through the remaining slots).

        5. VARA (Weekday) — 7 total
           The weekday, named after planets:
           Sunday=Sun, Monday=Moon, Tuesday=Mars, Wednesday=Mercury,
           Thursday=Jupiter, Friday=Venus, Saturday=Saturn.

    WHY PANCHANGA MATTERS:
        Hindus consult the Panchanga daily to determine auspicious
        (shubh) and inauspicious (ashubh) timings for activities like
        starting a business, travel, ceremonies, etc. The concept of
        "Muhurta" (electional astrology) is based on Panchanga elements.

    Attributes:
        date: The date this panchanga is for.
        vara: Weekday name (e.g., "Sunday" / "Ravivara").
        tithi_number: Tithi number (1-30). 1-15 = Shukla, 16-30 = Krishna.
